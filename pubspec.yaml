  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/logo.png
    - images/health_logo.png
    - images/toolchain_logo.png
    - images/aboutus_healthLife.png
    - images/aboutus_step.png
    - images/aboutus_vaccine.png
    - images/aboutus_terminal.png
    - assets/graphics/
  fonts:
    - family: Rubik
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Light.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik-Medium.ttf
          weight: 400
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
